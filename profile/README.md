## Lavenza

Lavenza was a project started in November of 2019.
It was a really ambitious project that would take a long time to finish.
Little did I know how much work would go into this project to even get 1/5th of the project completed.
I have since lost interest in this project and have decided to archive all of the repositories related to the project.
As of February 2023, the Lavenza Discord Bot Project is officially dead. The Discord Bot and the Website are currently in the process of being taken offline.
If you would like to fork the project and continue my work, you can do so if you would like, you don't even need to credit me if you decide to release the project.
Thank you to everyone who supported this project, I'm sorry I didn't peel the bandage off sooner.
